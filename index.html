										from the Refinery, or if Winner is unable to utilize Trip portion of the

										Prize, as determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion, Prize will be

										forfeited, and at the Refinery’s sole discretion and time permitting, the

										runner-up entrant with the next highest points based on the Judging Criteria

										may be selected as an alternate potential Winner.
										<br />
										<br />
										Exact travel dates will be determined by the Refinery in their sole

										discretion. Travel and hotel arrangements will be determined by the Refinery

										in its sole discretion. Once determined, no change, extension, or

										substitution of travel dates and/or times is permitted, except by the
